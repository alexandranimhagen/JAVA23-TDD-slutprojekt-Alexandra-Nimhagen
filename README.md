TDD Final Project – Java

A simple Java banking-style application developed entirely using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The focus was to build clean, structured code and ensure test coverage for all core functionalities.

Features

- Developed from scratch using TDD principles  
- Login system with user ID and PIN  
- Account balance viewing and basic transaction logic  
- Modular, readable and maintainable code  
- JUnit test coverage for all business logic

Test User Credentials

Use the following credentials to log in and test the application:

- **User ID:** `12345`  
- **PIN:** `1234`

Technologies Used

- Java  
- JUnit (unit testing)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Eclipse/IntelliJ (any Java IDE)

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandranimhagen/JAVA23-TDD-slutprojekt-Alexandra-Nimhagen.git
Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse)

Run Main.java (or equivalent entry point) to launch the program

To run tests, use your IDE’s built-in test runner or:
mvn test
(if using Maven)

What I Learned
This project allowed me to:

Apply test-driven development from the very beginning

Think in terms of test cases before implementation

Write clean, reusable, and modular code

Understand the importance of testing in real-world projects

This project was part of my Java developer education at Grit Academy and reflects my skills in TDD, problem-solving, and clean code practices.
